```
git clone https://github.com/symbioticfi/symbiotic-node.git
cd symbiotic-node

# Step 2: Install dependencies
npm install

# Step 3: Create the configuration file
echo '{
  "validator": {
    "name": "synenergy",
    "evm_address": "synenergy-evm"
  },
  "network": {
    "rpc_url": "https://rpc.symbiotic.fi",

# Step 4: Start the node
npm start -- --config ./config.json

# Step 5: (Optional) Docker setup
# Create a Dockerfile
echo 'FROM node:14
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 30303
CMD [ "npm", "start", "--", "--config", "./config.json" ]
' > Dockerfile

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t symbiotic-node .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -d --name symbiotic-node -p 30303:30303 symbiotic-node

# Step 6: Check logs (optional)
docker logs -f symbiotic-node
```

Within the **Airchains** project, Sun Energy plays a crucial role in deploying and maintaining nodes to uphold a secure and high-performing blockchain network. Our dedicated focus on security audits and performance optimization empowers the network to operate seamlessly, in line with our commitment to ensuring responsible and efficient blockchain operations.

Step 1: Setting Up the Server

1. Update Your Server:

   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

2. Install Git, Docker, and Docker Compose:

   sudo apt-get install git docker.io docker-compose -y
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker

3. Install Go:

   wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.18.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.18.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc

4. Install Node.js and NPM:

   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs


Step 2: Installing Airchains CLI

1. Clone the Airchains Repository:

   git clone https://github.com/airchains/airchains-node.git
   cd airchains-node

2. Build the Airchains CLI:

   make build
   sudo cp ./build/airchains /usr/local/bin/

3. Verify the Installation:

   airchains version

Step 3: Initializing and Configuring the Node

1. Initialize Your Validator Node:

   airchains init SunEnergy --chain-id airchains-1

2. Configure the Node:

   - Edit `config.toml`:

     nano ~/.airchains/config/config.toml

     - Set `persistent_peers` with a list of trusted peers.
     - Adjust `max_num_outbound_peers` and `max_num_inbound_peers` as needed.
     - Set `min_gas_prices` to prevent spam attacks.

   - Edit `app.toml`:

     nano ~/.airchains/config/app.toml

     - Enable the `api` and set the `cors_allowed_origins`.


Step 4: Starting the Node

1. Start the Node:

   airchains start

2. Check Logs:

   journalctl -u airchains -f

   Ensure your node is syncing with the network.

Step 5: Becoming a Validator

1. Create a New Wallet:

   airchains keys add sunenergy-wallet

2. Fund Your Wallet:
   Transfer enough AIR tokens to your wallet to meet the minimum staking requirement.

3. Submit the Validator Creation Transaction:

   airchains tx staking create-validator \
   --amount=1000000air \
   --pubkey=$(airchains tendermint show-validator) \
   --moniker="SunEnergy" \
   --chain-id=airchains-1 \
   --commission-rate="0.10" \
   --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
   --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
   --min-self-delegation="1" \
   --from=sunenergy-wallet \
   --gas=auto \
   --fees=200air

4. Confirm Your Validator:
   After the transaction is confirmed, your validator node will be active on the Airchains network.


Step 6: Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor Your Validator:
  Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor node performance.

- Upgrade the Node:
  Keep track of Airchains updates and apply them as necessary to maintain network compatibility.

- Backup Key Files:
  Regularly backup your validator keys and other critical files to avoid accidental loss.
